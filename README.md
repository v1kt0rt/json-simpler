Aim of this project is to give a simple way for dealing with dynamic JSON objects in java.

* Fluent interface makes easy to create compound objects.
* Monadic style make casts unnecessary.
* Internal implementation is based on json-simple.
* No 'unchecked' operations.
* This project is used in some of my hobby projects at this moment, and it works well.
* Ideas and contributions are welcome.
* Based on Java 7.
